<p class="section about desc">
    At the end of the day, basketball may be 'about getting buckets', but there is a lot more that goes
    on within the game that has significant impact on which team ends up getting those buckets. What Dean Oliver coined as the
    'Four Factors' summerizes the most important parts of the game captured by the traditional box score. Each of
    these four composite statistics can be calculated for each team to directly compare how each team fared using
    percentages or rates.

    <h2>The Four Factors</h2>

    <p>
        <b>Effective Field Goal Percentage (EFG%)</b><br />
        Formula: EFG% = (FieldGoalsMade + 0.5 * 3ptFieldGoalsMade) / FieldGoalsAttempted<br />
        Purpose: EFG% gives a measure of how efficently a team is scoring relative to their field goal attempts. Three
        point field goals are given extra weight because of the additional point they provide when made.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Turnover Percentage (TOV%)</b><br />
        Formula: TOV% = Turnovers / (FieldGoalsAttempted + 0.44 * FreeThrowsAttempted + Turnovers)<br />
        Purpose: TOV% is the percentage of total possesions that ended in a turnover.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Defensive Rebounding Percentage (DRB%)</b><br />
        Formula: DRB% = DefensiveRebounds / (OpponentOffensiveRebounds + DefensiveRebounds)<br />
        Purpose: DRB% is the percentage of available rebounds that a team claimed while on defense. This measure is
        sometimes measured as Offensive RB%, which is the same measure but from the opposite perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Free Throw Rate (FTR).</b><br />
        Formula: FTR = FreeThrowsMade / FieldGoalAttempts<br />
        Purpose: FTR is a measure of how often a team gets to the foul line. It is traditionally measured as
        FreeThrowsMade
        / FieldGoalAttempts or as FreeThrowAttempts / FieldGoalAttempts.
        For detailed information on these metrics, see Dean Oliver's "Basketball on Paper".
